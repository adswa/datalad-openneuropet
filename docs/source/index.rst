DataLad OpenNeuroPET
********************

`OpenNeuroPET <https://openneuropet.github.io/>`_  is a collaboration between Stanford university, NIH, MGH and the Neurobiology Research Unit (NRU) at Copenhagen University Hospital.
Its primary objective is built around OpenNeuro and BIDS, for open (CC0) or secure (DUA-GDPR) data sharing with a united front-end (OpenNeuro) and user friendly tools for the PET-BIDS data curation.
``datalad-openneuropet`` is a `DataLad <http://datalad.org>`__ extension
that equips DataLad with additional functionality to support OpenNeuroPET in these aims.
